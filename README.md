## MISSING STUFF <b>

REPORT <b>
- what to plot
- how to understand mesh (yplus, courant, ?)
- extract experimental data
  
kEps <b>
- extract graphs from paraview
- mesh sensitivity
- domain dimension (?)

kOmega <b>
- extract graphs from paraview
- mesh sensitivity (probably same mesh as kEps)


LES
- mesh accuracy (dx+, dy+, dz+ ?)
- k model
- 2% turbulence
- check output same as kEps
- check I.C.'s
- Add SEG
