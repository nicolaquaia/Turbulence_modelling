# Turbulence Modelling Course Report

## Overview
This report examines the fluid flow over a smooth cylinder and the associated vortex shedding at a Reynolds number (Re) of 3900. This value places the flow within the transitional regime, where the inlet flow is initially laminar, but perturbations around the cylinder generate turbulent eddies that are periodically shed along its wake [1].

### Key Objectives
1. Analyze flow dynamics over a smooth cylinder.
2. Explore vortex shedding behavior in the transitional flow regime.
3. Compare the performance of different turbulence models.

### Turbulence Models
Two categories of turbulence models are utilized:

1. **Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS):**
   - k−ϵ Model
   - k−ω Model

2. **Large Eddy Simulation (LES):**
   - k-equation Model
   - Smagorinsky Model

Additionally, a turbulent inflow with a Turbulent Intensity of 2% is generated using the Divergence-Free Synthetic Eddy Method (DFSEM) for LES models.
